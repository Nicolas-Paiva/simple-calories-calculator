# simple-calories-calculator
My very first project without any tutorial.

## For now, it is pure HTML and CSS, but as soon as I learn more JS, I will start adding functionality

## For now my knowledge in JS is limited. I only know the very basics about variables, functions, if statements, operators and so on.


# I believe that soon I will be able to start this project, but first I need to understand the fundamentals of JS
