My very first project without any tutorial.

## For now, it is pure HTML and CSS, but as soon as I learn more JS, I will start adding functionality

## For now my knowledge in JS is limited. I only know the very basics about variables, functions, if statements, operators and so on.

## I am trying to make the website responsve, but I realized that I still really suck at CSS, and I probably need to learn a lot.

## Right now I am reviewing the content I already learned otherwise I am going to forget everything

## Working with arrays is very challenging, but it w=is so good when I can solve a problem!
