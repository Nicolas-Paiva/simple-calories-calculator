# simple-calories-calculator
My very first project without any tutorial.

## For now, it is pure HTML and CSS, but as soon as I learn more JS, I will start adding functionality

## For now my knowledge in JS is limited. I only know the very basics about variables, functions, if statements, operators and so on.

## I am now trying to develop a simple BMI calculator

## For now the main focus is to develop a simple application that works as intended. It is not going to be very beautiful, but that's because I want to make it work first. From that point on, I will work on making it responsive and so on.
